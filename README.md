## OPEN Platform: A distributed network for Smart Contracts

OPEN Platform uses blockchain technology to leverage **smart contracts** in order to autonomously manage digital assets and to create a **smart economy** within a decentralized network.

## Explorer

### How to Contribute

OPEN Platform is available under the MIT License. You may contribute to the OPEN Platform project by submitting issues and PRs. The simple act of submitting issues regarding problems you encounter is a great way to contribute to OPEN Platform. We also appreciate greatly those who are able and willing to contribute code and implementations.

The OPEN Platform team uses and recommends the following workflow:

1. Create an issue describing the code you want to submit a pull-request for.
    **NOTES:**
    * You can skip this step for trivial changes.
    * Please reuse an existing issue, if one exists.
    * If you intend to fix the issue, please state your intentions to do so clearly within the documentation and request that the issue be assigned to you.  Please note, the person who files an issue and the person who implements a solution for it do not have to be the same person.
2. Create a personal fork of the repository on GitHub, if you don't
already have one.
3. Create a branch off of master(git checkout -b mybranch).
    **NOTES:**
    * Please use a meaningful name when naming your branch. Use a name that clearly communicates what you're trying to fix.  For example, **issue-88** or **peer-to-peer-issue** would be meaningful names.
    * Please use branches and do not submit a pull-request based on your local master branch.  Branches isolate your changes from other incoming upstream changes. They also enable you to create multiple pull-requests from the same fork.
4. Make and commit your changes.
5. Add new tests to test your code, if applicable.
6. Build the repository with your changes.
    **NOTES:**
    * Make sure the build is clean.
    * Make sure all tests are passing, including your new tests.
7. Create a pull-request (PR) against the upstream repository's master branch.
    * Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

**NOTE:** It is OK for your pull-request to include a large number of commits. Once your change is accepted, you will be asked to squash your commits into one or some appropriately small number of commits before your pull-request is merged.
